## Modifications in this fork
I, huzpsb, removed ALL OF THE PROTECTIVE HOOKS.This can lead into two results - Firstly, you can have a significant performance update by cutting the hooks. Secondly, you can have more active players.To keep all the player's data safe is a good idea, but by deleting them after a certain period can let you have your player more active.

Have fun!
